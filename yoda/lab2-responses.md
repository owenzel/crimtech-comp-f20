3. y.includes("hello") searches the string stored in y for the string passed in as a parameter to includes ("hello"). It returns true if the parameter "hello" is in y and false if it is not. y.repeat(10) returns the string in y the number of times passed in as a parameter (10). Each repetition is concatenated to the previous instances of y, thereby returning 1 string.
4. square(2.5) returns 6.25, which is the actual square of 2.5. square("hello") returns NaN, which represents "Not-a-Number" value. This makes sense because, by passing "hello" into square, I attempted to square something that is not numerical (a word contained in a string), which is not a valid operation.
